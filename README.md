# MacAEV – McMaster Autonomous Electrified Vehicle 🚗⚡

A real-time embedded control and autonomous navigation system for a 1/10th scale electric RC vehicle. Developed using ROS on a Jetson Nano, the system integrates LiDAR and IMU-based localization, mapping, and control algorithms to enable manual, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous driving modes.

> 📍 Built as part of **ELECENG 3EY4: Electrical Systems Integration Project** at McMaster University (Winter 2025)

## 🧠 Project Structure

The system was built over 8 iterative modules:

1. Linux command-line & ROS setup on Jetson Nano  
2. Hardware testing & udev configuration  
3. VESC programming and ESC control via ROS  
4. Manual driving and odometry calibration  
5. Localization using LiDAR + IMU  
6. Mapping with occupancy grids  
7. PD + feedback-linearizing controller  
8. (Bonus) RGB-D integration using RealSense camera  

Each component was tested in simulation (F1TENTH) before deployment on the physical vehicle.
