## ðŸ”Œ System Overview

This embedded system uses a **Jetson Nano** running **ROS** to control the McMaster AEV platform in both manual and autonomous modes. The system integrates:

- **Electric Propulsion Control (VESC-based)**
- **LiDAR & Odometry-based Localization**
- **Mapping & Grid Occupancy Algorithms**
- **PD + Feedback-Linearizing Control**
- **Quadratic Optimization for Virtual Barriers**
- **(Bonus) RGB-D Camera for Enhanced Mapping**

---

## ðŸ§° Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit  
- VESC-compatible Electronic Speed Controller  
- 360Â° 2D LiDAR (e.g., RPLiDAR A1/A2)  
- RGB-D Camera (e.g., Intel RealSense D435 â€“ optional)  
- ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04  
- Python 3.8+  
- Required Libraries: `rospy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `open3d`

---

### Hardware Setup

- Connect **LiDAR** to Jetson Nano via USB.  
- Connect **VESC** via UART to Jetson.  
- Power the propulsion system through the **battery circuit**.  
- Mount the **RGB-D camera** (if used) on the front chassis.  
- Ensure the **Jetson Nano is flashed and ROS is installed**.
